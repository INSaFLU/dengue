# Nextstrain repository for dengue virus

This repository contains two workflows for the analysis of dengue virus data:

- [`ingest/`](./ingest) - Download data from GenBank, clean and curate it and upload it to S3
- [`phylogenetic/`](./phylogenetic) - Make phylogenetic trees for nextstrain.org

Each folder contains a README.md with more information.
